# ðŸš€ Build a React App from Scratch

## ðŸ”¹ Why build from scratch?
- When you have **special requirements** not covered by frameworks.
- To **learn the fundamentals** of how React works under the hood.
- To **experiment** with building your own framework.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Choose a Build Tool
React needs a build tool to run locally and prepare production builds.

Popular choices:
- **Vite** âš¡ (modern, fast)
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
  ```
- **Parcel** ðŸ“¦ (zero config, scalable)
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev parcel
  ```
- **Rsbuild** ðŸš€ (high performance with Rspack)
  ```bash
  npx create-rsbuild --template react
  ```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Add Core Features
When starting with SPA, you need to add manually:
1. **Routing** â†’ React Router, Tanstack Router.  
2. **Data Fetching** â†’ React Query, SWR, RTK Query.  
3. **GraphQL** â†’ Apollo, Relay.  
4. **Code Splitting** â†’ supported by Vite, Parcel, Rsbuild.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Rendering Strategies
- **SPA** â†’ simple, slower initial load.  
- **SSR** â†’ server prepares HTML (faster).  
- **SSG** â†’ prebuilt HTML at build time (great for static pages).  
- **RSC** â†’ split components between server and client (advanced).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary
- From-scratch setup = full control, but more effort.  
- Frameworks like **Next.js** or **Remix** provide these features out of the box.
